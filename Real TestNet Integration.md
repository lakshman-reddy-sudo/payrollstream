Now I have a thorough understanding of the current codebase. Let me look at the previous conversation artifacts for more context, then present the enhancement options to the user.

### User Input

1,4,6,

### Planner Response

Let me first look at the existing source files in detail to plan the implementation precisely:

*Viewed [store.js](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/store.js) *

*Viewed [GrantDetail.jsx](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/pages/GrantDetail.jsx) *

### Planner Response

Now let me also look at the existing CSS and Landing page to understand the full picture:

*Viewed [index.css](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/index.css) *

*Viewed [vite.config.js](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/vite.config.js) *

### Planner Response

Now I have a full understanding of the codebase. Let me create the task.md and implementation plan:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Now let me write the implementation plan. Since this is a React app with no tests, the verification will be build + browser testing:

*Edited relevant file*

### User Input

baically not real but like demo funds shd be there r

### Planner Response

Got it — demo/simulated funds, not real on-chain transactions. So the "TestNet integration" will be a realistic **simulation** with proper-looking transaction IDs, live-looking balances, AlgoExplorer-style links, and the full flow — just without actually needing a Pera Wallet connection. This makes it much smoother for hackathon demos too!

Let me jump into building all 3 features now.

### Planner Response

Let me start by upgrading [algorand.js](cci:7://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/algorand.js:0:0-0:0) with simulation helpers, then build all the new files in parallel:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Good, algorand.js is done. Now let me rewrite the GrantDetail.jsx with simulated blockchain integration, create the Analytics page, and the Public Transparency page in parallel:

### User Input

no wait, i want tstnet but i meant, no fake.
like, ive got an idea. so we r 3. well create 3 testnet accs using pera wallet n act as 3 diff individual roles. so u add coonect w pera for 3 diff roles n each acc has 10 algo so wecan spend 1, 1 algo for each test on the website n all. wt do u say?

### Planner Response

That's a great plan! 🔥 Real TestNet transactions with 3 Pera Wallet accounts — one per role. Each person connects their wallet, and all fund transfers, milestone releases, and expense logs happen as **real on-chain transactions** with small ALGO amounts. That'll impress the judges way more than simulated data.

Let me build this properly. First let me check the current state of GrantDetail after your edits, then implement real Pera Wallet signing throughout.

*Viewed [GrantDetail.jsx](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/pages/GrantDetail.jsx) *

### Planner Response

Good, I can see the user reverted GrantDetail.jsx back to the original simpler version. Now I need to build **real** TestNet integration. The approach:

1. **Sponsor** connects Pera → funds escrow (real ALGO transfer) → releases milestone funds (real payment to team wallet)
2. **Team** connects Pera → logs expenses as real 0-ALGO self-transactions with notes
3. **All transactions** are real on-chain with real txn IDs, viewable on Pera Explorer

Let me now build all the files. I'll start with [algorand.js](cci:7://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/algorand.js:0:0-0:0) (real transaction helpers), then [GrantDetail.jsx](cci:7://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/pages/GrantDetail.jsx:0:0-0:0) with real signing, and the Analytics + Public pages:

### Planner Response

I see my GrantDetail.jsx write was incomplete. Let me fix that and build all the files properly now.

### Planner Response

Good. Now I need to update [App.jsx](cci:7://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/App.jsx:0:0-0:0) with the new routes, add login page public link, update the store for the [updateGrant](cci:1://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/store.js:107:0-114:1) function, and add new CSS. Let me read App.jsx and store.js first:

*Viewed [App.jsx](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/App.jsx) *

*Viewed [store.js](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/store.js) *

### Planner Response

Now I need to check if [updateGrant](cci:1://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/store.js:107:0-114:1) exists in store.js, and then update App.jsx, store.js, Login.jsx, and CSS. Let me check store.js for updateGrant:

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

The grep found [updateGrant](cci:1://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/store.js:107:0-114:1) exists. Let me view it to see the signature:

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

Good, [updateGrant](cci:1://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/store.js:107:0-114:1) exists. Now let me update App.jsx with the new routes and nav links, Login.jsx with the public link, and add CSS for the spinning animation and public header:

### Planner Response

Now I need to add the `Link` import to Login.jsx since I'm using `Link`:

### Planner Response

Now let me add the CSS for spinner, public header, and other new styles. Let me check the end of the CSS file first:

*Viewed [index.css](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/index.css) *

### Planner Response

Good, now let me add the new CSS styles and update the task checklist:

### Planner Response

Now let me run the build to verify everything compiles:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && npm run build 2>&1`*

### Planner Response

Build succeeded with zero errors! ✅ The only warning is about chunk size (the algosdk bundle is large), which is fine. Let me now start the dev server and verify in the browser:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && npm run dev 2>&1`*

### Planner Response

Dev server is running. Let me test all the pages in the browser:

### User Input

getting this error when im scanning thru my pera mobile app

### Planner Response

That's a network mismatch error — your Pera Wallet is on TestNet but the dApp is defaulting to MainNet. The fix is in [wallet.js](cci:7://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/utils/wallet.js:0:0-0:0) — the `chainId` parameter might not be recognized by your version of `@perawallet/connect`. Let me fix it:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Added `network: 'testnet'` to the Pera Wallet config. The dev server (Vite) should auto-reload. Try scanning the QR code again in Pera — it should connect now without the network mismatch error!

If it still gives the same error, make sure:
1. Your Pera Wallet app is set to **TestNet** (tap the network dropdown at the top of Pera → select TestNet)
2. Refresh the browser page before scanning again

### User Input

ohk reset whole website data. i mean, weve used n tetsed things r

also, make sure everythings working

### User Input

Clearing all localStorage data and verifying full app flow in browser



### Planner Response

Let me clear the data and verify everything directly:

### User Input

ohk perfect i now have 3 diff pera testnet accs. so uve to make sure when i login, it sdh be saved in the website. and push it to my github pages

### Planner Response

Let me first check git status and the repo setup, then update Login.jsx to connect wallet during login:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && git status 2>&1 && echo "---REMOTE---" && git remote -v 2>&1`*

*Viewed [Login.jsx](file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/pages/Login.jsx) *

### Planner Response

Good — git is initialized on `main` branch but no remote is set. Let me now:
1. Update Login.jsx to connect Pera Wallet during login (so wallet is tied to the role)
2. Configure Vite for GitHub Pages
3. Push everything

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Now I need to update [App.jsx](cci:7://file:///Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker/src/App.jsx:0:0-0:0) to pass the `onWalletConnect` prop to Login, and also configure Vite for GitHub Pages. Let me also check if the user's GitHub repo exists:

*Edited relevant file*

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && gh repo list lakshman-reddy-sudo --limit 20 2>&1 | grep grant`*

### Planner Response

No `gh` CLI results — let me check directly:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && git remote -v 2>&1 && echo "---" && cat .gitignore 2>&1`*

### Planner Response

No remote set. Let me set up. I'll configure Vite for GitHub Pages, add the remote, build, and deploy:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Now since we're using `BrowserRouter` with GitHub Pages (which doesn't support client-side routing), I need to switch to `HashRouter`:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Now let me build, create the GitHub repo, and deploy:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && npm run build 2>&1`*

### Planner Response

Build successful. Now let me create the GitHub repo and push:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && git remote add origin https://github.com/lakshman-reddy-sudo/grant-tracker.git 2>&1 || echo "remote already exists"`*

### Planner Response

Remote added. Now let me commit all changes and push, then set up GitHub Pages:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && git add -A && git commit -m "feat: Real Algorand TestNet integration, Analytics Dashboard, Public Transparency Page

- Real Pera Wallet signing for fund release & expense logging
- Wallet connection on login page (saved per role)
- Analytics with milestone donut, expense bars, fund utilization
- Public transparency page (no login required) at /public
- AlgoExplorer/Pera Explorer links for all txn IDs
- HashRouter for GitHub Pages SPA compatibility" 2>&1`*

### Planner Response

Good, committed. Now push to GitHub and set up Pages:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && git push -u origin main 2>&1`*

### Planner Response

Repo doesn't exist yet. Let me create it first:

*User accepted the command `cd /Users/lakshmanreddy/ML/grant-tracker && gh repo create lakshman-reddy-sudo/grant-tracker --public --source=. --push 2>&1`*
